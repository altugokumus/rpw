        <h1>Altug Okumus</h1>
        <p>I graduated from Adnan Menderes University, Department of Tourism and Hotel Management. Since 2006, I have worked in many corporate companies in the fields of tourism, organization and food and beverage. I had the opportunity to work in the United States for about two years. I've been running my own business for the past four years.</p>
        <p>I took a career change path by transferring my business in September. I have been trying to improve myself in this field with the Software Developer training that I have been continuing face-to-face and the training I have received from various sources online.</p>
        <p>At the point I have come, I have got an idea about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ReactJS, ES6, DOM, EJS, NPM, NodeJS, JQuery, Hyper, Express technologies at the beginning stage and I can build various structures.</p>
